# Pistol-Detection-in-Videos
This folder provides the first data-set, illustrations and results of the pistol-detector developed by: Roberto Olmos, Siham Tabik, Francisco Herrera

1. The complete description of the detection model can be found in this paper:

Automatic Handgun Detection Alarm in Videos Using Deep Learning. R Olmos, S Tabik, F Herrera.
Neurocomputing. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2017.05.012.

2. File "ComplementaryMaterial.pdf" shows five Figures, Figure 1 and 2 illustrates 6 images from database-2 and database-5. Figure 3, 4 and 5 show some results of the detection model.


3. The videos with the detections (bounding boxes) are named as video-1, -2, -3,-4, -5, -6 and 7.  


4. The thirty scenes used in the expriments are zipped in independent files labeled from 1 to 13.

5. The first dataset is included in this folder:
